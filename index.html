                <p>        
                In this game the users wil have access to mint a single NFT for a single transaction. Once the user mints the NFT that person is obliged to transfer it with anyone and again receiver has to tranfer this NFT to someone else and so on until a WIN is declared in the NFT. Everytime a person transfer's the NFT to other person, the contents of the NFT changes. The individual has to share these NFT until its declared in the NFT that the user has won.
                </p>
                   
                <p>
                    This game is inspired from the traditional Musical Chairs game, but the rules are changed a bit. Instead of the person losing the game when the music stops, here in this game the individual wins when its declared a win in the NFT.
                </p>
                  
                <p>
                    In this game the users wont have any idea when the "WIN" is declared in the NFT. Each NFT token will have some random number associated with it, when the number of exchanges cross that random number, the NFT property changes to WIN and Victory is declared to the user who holds that NFT in thier wallet.</h2>
