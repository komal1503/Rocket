# Pass The NFT

## Description
Pass The NFT is a NFT game built on Polygon Blockchain.

Once the user mints the NFT that person is obliged to transfer it with anyone and again receiver has to tranfer this NFT to someone else and so on until a WIN is declared in the NFT. Everytime a person transfer's the NFT to other person, the contents of the NFT changes. The individual has to share these NFT until its declared in the NFT that the user has won.

This game is inspired from the traditional Musical Chairs game, but the rules are changed a bit. Instead of the person losing the game when the music stops, here in this game the individual wins when its declared a win in the NFT.
